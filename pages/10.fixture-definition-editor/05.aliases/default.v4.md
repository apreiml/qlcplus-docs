In this tab it is possible to define the rules of replacement triggered by capabilities set as "Alias" preset.  
Let's make an example. A fixture has channel 5 named "Effects" which controls the behavior of channel 6. Channel 5 has 2 capabilities: "Speed on channel 6" and "Sound sensitivity on channel 6". The latter have been set to the "Alias" preset. By default, when DMX value of channel 5 is 0, channel 6 acts as speed control. When DMX value of channel 5 enters the "sound sensitivity" capability, channel 6 becomes a sound sensitivity adjustment.  
To cope with this case, you need to define 2 channels: "Speed" and "Sound sensitivity". In the fixture mode add only "Speed", since it will the default behavior when DMX value of channel 5 is equal to 0.  
Then you need to define just one alias: the one that will replace the default channel "Speed" with "Sound sensitivity". QLC+ will then know what to do when the DMX value of channel 5 enters or exits the alias.
