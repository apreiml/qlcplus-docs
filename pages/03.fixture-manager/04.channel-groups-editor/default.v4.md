The Channel Groups editor it activated by clicking on the "Channels Groups" tab in the [Fixture Manager](/fixture-manager) panel.  
With this functionality (introduced in QLC+ version 4.0.0), it is possible to create groups of channels with the same functionality.  
For example, if you have 20 PARs you might want to control the RED channel of all of them with a single fader.
